# Weather Classification with CNN and Pretrained ResNet18

This project focuses on classifying weather types from images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The model was initially trained using a custom-built CNN, and later, a pretrained ResNet18 architecture was employed to improve performance.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to classify weather images into various categories. The weather conditions to predict include:

- **Dew**
- **Fog/Smog**
- **Frost**
- **Glaze**
- **Hail**
- **Lightning**
- **Rain**
- **Rainbow**
- **Rime**
- **Sandstorm**
- **Snow**
